## What is it?

A11yBuddy is the software behind an innovative web portal that empowers everyone to report and track digital accessibility issues. The goal is to bring developers, designers and users of Software together by replacing hard-to-read audit results with abstract success criteria to true-to-life user workflows.

Developers and designers are additionally assisted by an audit wizard that helps them identify the most pressing issues with their application. This is going to be so simple that you don't need to be directly involved in software development to use it! So if your translation or community teams are up for it, they can use the tool as well, with virtually no downsides to developers doing it themselves.

Because everything on a11yBuddy is public, users with disabilities can use it to make informed decisions about whether a given software is accessible to them and where the real issues are. They can also use it to make qualitative reports to developers of an application, so they know exactly where to find and how to address an issue.

The hope is that this will contribute massively to an open and inclusive society, and for the first time ever, will make the state of digital accessibility visible to a public audience.

At some point during the initial development phase, we will launch a public instance of a11yBuddy, where everyone can test their own applications and contribute to the database.

## Community

We are currently in the process of setting up a community around a11yBuddy. If you are interested in contributing, have questions about accessibility, or want to discuss the project, please join us on [our Discord Server](https://discord.gg/c2dYvNcaaW).

## How will it work?

The following mockup describes roughly how the project will look like and how it will work. We are working hard to provide an interactive MVP in the coming weeks.

![Screenshot of a website on which the project is presented with a brief explanation. There is a list of so-called "workflows". One of these workflows is "Apply for funding". For this workflow, there is a list of five steps that need to be taken in order to achieve the goal. They are shown in a table. Each step is described in the first column, for example: "Visit the "Apply now" link". Behind this, the accessibility for different user groups for this step is shown in five columns. This specific step may not be accessible for people with visual impairments, but is accessible for everyone else. If you click on the test result, you will receive a short summary. For the step "Fill out the application form" in this workflow, which is not accessible for screen reader users, the summary is: "The page language is set to English despite of its German content. The third-party text editor does not have accessible labels for buttons and is extremely difficult to use." Steps that cannot be used by at least one group are highlighted in red. Steps that may cause minor problems for at least one group are highlighted in yellow.](.github/mockup.png)

## Funding

From March 2024 to August 2024, a11yBuddy's development is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research as part of the [Prototype Fund](https://prototypefund.de) by the [Open Knowledge Foundation Germany](https://okfn.de). Thank you very much!

## Free Consulting Offer
