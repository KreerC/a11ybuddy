# a11yBuddy

a11yBuddy is a web application that helps developers to document and test the accessibility of their own applications by utilising precise workflows and user stories. With time, it will evolve into a community platform, where developers and users alike can meet, learn and share their experiences, working together to improve the accessibility of software applications all over the world. 

This is a small revolution in the space of digital accessibility, because together and for the very first time, using a11yBuddy, we will build a huge database of real-world accessibility problems and good examples - that, unlike most audit results, will be understandible and actionable for developers and help users make informed decisions about whether a software is accessible for them, before having to spend several hours and possibly lots of frustration on trying it out. 

At some point during the initial development phase, we will launch a public instance of a11yBuddy, where everyone can test their own applications and contribute to the database.

More documentation and information on how a11yBuddy will work will be available shortly.
